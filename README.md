# Task-decomspoition-and-allocation-for-multi-robot-SMP
Task is described by an automaton, and then is decomposed into parallel subtasks. (https://github.com/huanfez/dk.brics.automaton can be used to decompose the task automton.)
Local tasks are assigned to robots and performed with the subtask automaton regulated logics.
Motion planning is performed with symbolic motion planning. (The same way with https://github.com/huanfez/Multi-robot-motion-planning-with-discrete-control   https://github.com/huanfez/Reactive-Synthesis-based-Collision-Avoidance-for-Symbolic-Motion-Planning)
